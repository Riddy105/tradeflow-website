          Tradeflow Expansion Broker is a marketplace for established businesses
          to directly connect with a robust network of micro-entrepreneurs
          across Africa. Starting with Nigeria - Africa's largest economy and
          most populous nation, with a focus on the software retail industry,
          Tradeflow will help established enterprise and consumer software
          companies connect and sell directly to the micro-entrepreneurs - local
          software vendors and MSMEs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the mission of every thriving business to continue to broaden
          their reach, grow their revenue and deepen their impact. Through the
          tools we provide, established businesses can explore the immense
          opportunities presented by other business expansion alternatives such
          as franchising, licensing, distributorship, strategic partnership, and
          agent network solutions - all of which fit perfectly into the African
          context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leveraging technology and local market expertise, we set out to enable
          established businesses to enter into new markets quickly and firmly,
          with little to no regulatory/compliance hassle, and from a strong
          local market understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          A trade-tech startup, Tradeflowâ€™s Expansion Broker will prioritize
          conversion franchising, microfranchising, and agent network solutions.
